# Linear Regression Gradient descent

There is an example of simple gradient descent algorithm for the linear regression task

# Packages
* Python ~ 3.7.6
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn 

# What you can do with this repository?
1. Learn how to make an GD algorithm in python and use it on real dataset
2. Find an example of sklearn Linear Regression

# How to use this

1. Install packages from the list above
2. Run linear_regression_algo.py
2.1 It reads data from dataset folder home_data.csv. You can change behaviour in datasets.py
2.2 –êfter completion of the algorithm you will see all epoch on plots
